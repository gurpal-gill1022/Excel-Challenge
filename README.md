# Excel Challenge: Crowdfunding Project

# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to organize and analyze a dataset of 1,000 sample projects. These projects were done by organizations with the goal of receiving funding from Crowdfunding Platforms.

A thorough analysis was conducted on the raw data using Excel, followed by a Written Report that addressed the following questions:
1. Three conclusions about crowdfunding campaigns.
2. Any limitations of the dataset.
3. Other possible tables or graphs that could have been used.
4. Determine whether the mean or median summarizes the data.
5. Determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns.
